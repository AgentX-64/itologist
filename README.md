# Itologist Nuxt Site

Minimal Nuxt 3 + Tailwind project for the Itologist marketing site.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

To generate a static site:

```bash
npm run generate
```

You still need to:

- Install Nuxt 3 / nuxi (or use npx).
- Replace `YOUR_FORMSPREE_ID` in the contact forms with your actual endpoint.
- Update the email address if needed.
